# Treasure hunt

Author: Gustavo Silvera

Design: (TODO: In two sentences or fewer, describe what is new and interesting about your game.)

Text Drawing: (TODO: how does the text drawing in this game work? Is text precomputed? Rendered at runtime? What files or utilities are involved?)

Choices: The choices in this choice-based text adventure are authored from a narrators perspective and provide options to change player state (such as an inventory system). This makes some game paths only possible with the right combination of inventory/choice options.
